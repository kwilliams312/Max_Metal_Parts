These have not been printed yet, due to an issue with my current 3D printer (it is halfway torn apart at the moment).

For more Max Metal parts, take a look at: [ccavanaugh/Max-Metal](https://github.com/ccavanaugh/Max-Metal). 

The Max Metal frame models are __FOR REFERENCE ONLY__! Do yourself a favor and [buy it from Trick Laser](http://www.tricklaser.com/MAX-METAL-build-parts_c2.htm)
