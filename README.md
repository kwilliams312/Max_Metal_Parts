# Parts for the TrickLaser Max Metal

The parts were designed for my Max Metal frame using Autodesk Fusion 360.

I have included STL, IGES, and STEP files for each part; except for the frame.

The Max Metal frame models are __FOR REFERENCE ONLY__! Do yourself a favor and [buy it from Trick Laser](http://www.tricklaser.com/MAX-METAL-build-parts_c2.htm)
